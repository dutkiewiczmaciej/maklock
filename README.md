## What is MakLock?

MakLock is a lightweight menu bar app that protects your macOS applications with Touch ID or a backup password. When someone tries to open a protected app, MakLock shows a lock overlay and requires authentication before granting access.

## Installation

### Download

> First release coming soon. Download the latest `.dmg` from [Releases](https://github.com/dutkiewiczmaciej/maklock/releases).

### Build from Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dutkiewiczmaciej/maklock.git
cd maklock
open MakLock.xcodeproj
```

Build and run with `Cmd+R`. Requires Xcode 15+ and macOS 13+.

## Architecture

MakLock is a native Swift/SwiftUI application distributed outside the App Store for full overlay and process management capabilities.

```
MakLock/
  App/        Entry point, AppDelegate, AppState
  Core/       Services, Managers, Storage
  UI/         Design system, Components, Views
  Models/     Data models
  Resources/  Assets, Entitlements
```

**Key frameworks:** SwiftUI, AppKit, LocalAuthentication, CoreBluetooth, IOKit, HotKey (SPM)

## Safety

MakLock includes multiple safety mechanisms to ensure you never get locked out:

- **Panic key** — `Cmd+Option+Shift+Control+U` instantly dismisses all overlays
- **System blacklist** — Terminal, Xcode, Activity Monitor, and other system apps can never be locked
- **Timeout failsafe** — Overlays auto-dismiss after 60 seconds without interaction
- **Dev mode** — DEBUG builds include a Skip button and 10-second auto-dismiss

## Requirements

- macOS 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- Apple Silicon or Intel Mac
- Touch ID recommended (password fallback available)
